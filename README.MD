# Gameduino Advance

This is a personal project to create a Handheld gameconsole with an Atmega386 MCU (either Arduino bootloader or smaller)
and a Color TFT. More details will come

## Hardware

Detail will come, basicly a Atmega386 and a 2.2'' TFT are required aswell as a PCF8574 for button readout
The ILI9225 TFT with onboard 74HC245 Octal bus transciever is used to convert Arduinos 5v I/O to 3.3 I/O of the TFT
The screen has a 176Ã—220 resolution.

The TFT comes with a MicroSD card slot, we currently dont use it. 

The Arduino pins are connected as following:
Arduino notation: Chip pin, Name, arduino pin name.

| Arduino  | TFT     | Pin name         |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| 5V       | 1       | VCC              |
| GND      | 2,3 GND | GND              |
| -        | NC      | Not con          |
| 28,PC5,A5| 7       | CLK              |
| 27,PC4,A4| 8       | SDA              |
| 14,D8,PB0| 9       | RS               |
| RESET,P6 | 10      | RST              |
| 15,D9,PB1| 11      | CS (chip select) |

CS could be connected to GND to save a pin and always be selected (we dont like that in our case)
RS is chosen to be 8, to freeup a ADC. 
RST is connected to Reset in our case, but if connected to a I/O you could reset the display at your descretion.
 For Hardware SPI (what we plan to use), CLK and SDA are locked to their pins.

## Code compilation

A make file is included and the following commands are supported:
Making all objects and compile the final executable
```
make 
``` 

To make AND upload the program to the first valid Serialport use:
``` 
make program
```

To clean all objects and compiled executables run:
```
make clean
```

### Libraries
For this project we arent going to use Arduino libs, instead we find or make our own that work as far as Arduino posible.

#### uart
This library is copied from X to enable debugging of the kernel and games over Serial rs232
#### blink
A simple Blink lib, 
#### I2C
This library should still be made, support for I2C devices
#### SPI
This library should allow Communication over SPI bus to devices
#### TFT
The TFT library (requireing the SPI lib) enables us to write to the TFT and draw :D


## Games

A few games are planned to be build into the system, later maybe more options aswell removing the default ones

## Future plans

There are non sofar.
